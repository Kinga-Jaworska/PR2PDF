        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>This pull request represents a foundational, yet high-risk, delivery for the 'Evidence App'. It introduces the core MVP functionality, including Google authentication, task creation, and time slot management. While this signifies a major feature delivery milestone, the pull request's massive scope (30 files, ~2600 new lines), non-descriptive title ('Test'), and incomplete implementation (numerous 'TODOs') pose significant risks to project timelines, quality, and maintainability. This 'big bang' integration requires immediate strategic intervention to de-risk the deployment and stabilize the project's development lifecycle.</p>
    </div>

    
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Executive Summary: Business Value vs. Project Risk</h2>
            <p>This submission delivers critical business value by providing the first functional version of the application's core features. It enables user authentication and the primary workflow of task and time entry. However, the method of deliveryâ€”a single, monolithic pull requestâ€”introduces substantial project risk. The immediate business gain is tempered by the high probability of integration issues, a prolonged and difficult code review process, and the accumulation of technical debt that will impact future velocity. This PR effectively moves the project from boilerplate to a functional prototype, but requires a dedicated stabilization phase.</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>Business Value Delivered: Google Authentication, Task Creation & Editing, Time Slot Addition.</li><li>User Experience Impact: Replaces placeholder content with the application's primary user interface and workflows.</li><li>Primary Risk: Large, monolithic change increases the likelihood of bugs and makes quality assurance difficult.</li><li>Project Status: Marks the completion of a major development phase, but simultaneously introduces a critical, high-effort review and integration phase.</li>
                </ul>
            
        </div>
    
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Feature Impact Analysis</h2>
            <p>The features introduced are central to the project's objectives as outlined in the updated README. This PR transforms the project from a concept into a tangible application that can be tested internally.</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>Google Authentication: Implements user sign-in via Google, a core requirement for user management.</li><li>Task & Time Management: Delivers the primary user journey of creating a project task, adding descriptions, and logging time against it.</li><li>CRUD Functionality: Introduces forms and modals for Creating (tasks, time slots), Reading (tasks), and Updating (tasks) data.</li><li>Reporting Dependency: Lays the groundwork for the CSV report generation feature mentioned in the README, as it provides the necessary data entry points.</li>
                </ul>
            
        </div>
    
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Timeline and Resource Considerations</h2>
            <p>This pull request represents a significant block of development effort, likely spanning multiple weeks or an entire sprint. Its size will have a cascading effect on project timelines.</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>Timeline Acceleration & Bottleneck: While it delivers a large feature set at once, it creates an immediate bottleneck for QA and code review resources. The project timeline must now account for a potentially lengthy stabilization period that was not required with smaller, iterative PRs.</li><li>Resource Allocation: A significant portion of the development team's time will now be required to review, test, and merge this single change. This diverts resources from new feature development.</li><li>Hidden Work: The presence of 'TODO' comments for error handling and security (moving from localStorage to cookies) indicates that the feature is not complete. These items must be tracked as new tasks and factored into the project plan.</li>
                </ul>
            
        </div>
    
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies</h2>
            <p>The primary risks are related to process, quality, and technical architecture. Proactive mitigation is required to prevent these risks from causing project delays or failures.</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>High Integration Risk: Merging 30 changed files at once is highly likely to cause conflicts and introduce undiscovered bugs. Mitigation: Allocate dedicated developer time for a careful, staged merge and subsequent smoke testing.</li><li>Poor Code Quality Visibility: The PR title 'Test' and its large size make it difficult for reviewers to assess quality and correctness thoroughly. Mitigation: Mandate a policy for descriptive PR titles and enforce smaller, single-purpose pull requests going forward.</li><li>Technical Debt & Security: The use of localStorage for authentication tokens and unhandled errors are critical issues. Mitigation: Create high-priority tickets to address all 'TODOs' before any user-facing release.</li><li>Backend Dependency: The functionality is critically dependent on a running backend service ('Evidence_BE'). Mitigation: Ensure the backend is stable and available for the QA team. Coordinate deployments between frontend and backend.</li><li>Architectural Ambiguity: The inclusion of Redux, Zustand, and React Query suggests a lack of a clear architectural decision on state management. Mitigation: Schedule an architectural review to establish a clear standard to prevent future complexity and code inconsistency.</li>
                </ul>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Stakeholder Communication Points</h2>
            <p>Communication should highlight the progress while being transparent about the risks and next steps.</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>To Product Owners: 'The initial version of the core application, including Google login and task entry, is now ready for internal review. This is a significant milestone that unblocks user feedback and testing.'</li><li>To Development Team: 'This PR demonstrates immense progress, but we must refine our process. Future work should be submitted in smaller, feature-focused pull requests with descriptive titles to facilitate efficient review and reduce risk.'</li><li>To QA Team: 'A large feature set is ready for testing. Please prepare a comprehensive test plan covering the end-to-end user flows for authentication, task creation, and time logging. Be aware of incomplete error handling as noted in the code.'</li><li>In Project Status Reports: 'Development of the MVP feature set is complete. We are now entering a dedicated integration and quality assurance phase to stabilize the application before proceeding with new features.'</li>

        <div class="test-scenarios">
            <h2>ðŸ“‹ Recommended Test Scenarios</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Verify a new user can successfully log in using a valid Google account.</li><li>Verify the application handles a failed Google login attempt gracefully.</li><li>Test the creation of a new task with all fields filled correctly.</li><li>Test the task creation form's validation (e.g., submitting with an empty project name, invalid duration format).</li><li>Verify a user can open the 'Edit Task' modal and successfully update a task's details.</li><li>Verify a user can add a new time slot to an existing task.</li><li>Confirm that after a successful task creation, the user is redirected to the '/start' page.</li><li>Test the application's behavior when the backend API is unavailable or returns an error.</li>

        <div class="recommendations">
            <h2>ðŸ’¡ Recommendations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Do not merge as-is. Conduct a multi-person review meeting to walk through the changes.</li><li>Enforce a strict policy immediately for meaningful PR titles and descriptions.</li><li>Break down future work into smaller, incremental pull requests aligned with individual user stories.</li><li>Create technical debt tickets for all 'TODO' comments and prioritize them for the next sprint.</li><li>Schedule an architectural review to finalize the state management strategy (Redux vs. Zustand vs. React Query).</li><li>Update the PR title and description to accurately reflect its contents before proceeding.</li>
