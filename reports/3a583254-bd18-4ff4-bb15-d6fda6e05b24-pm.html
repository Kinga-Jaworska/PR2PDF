        <h1>Project Management Analysis: Introduction of Customizable Report Templates</h1>

    </div>

    <div class="summary">
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>This pull request introduces a significant enhancement to the reporting functionality by enabling the use of custom templates. This feature shifts the system from a static, one-size-fits-all reporting model to a dynamic and flexible solution, allowing tailored communication for different stakeholders such as Project Managers, QA, and Clients. The primary business impact is improved communication efficiency, clarity, and stakeholder satisfaction by delivering more relevant and targeted information.</p>
    </div>

    
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
            <p>The proposed changes add the capability to generate pull request analysis reports from user-defined templates, fetched from a new API endpoint. The user interface in both the 'Recent Pull Requests' component and the main 'Pull Requests' page has been updated to display a categorized dropdown menu, allowing users to select either a default report or a specific template for different audiences (PM, QA, Client). This feature directly supports project governance and communication milestones by providing customizable artifacts for status updates, quality reviews, and client presentations.</p>
            
        </div>
    
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Feature Impact Analysis</h2>
            <p>This feature introduces a major user-facing enhancement with direct business value.</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>User-Facing Change: The 'Generate Report' button now triggers a structured dropdown menu, sectioned by audience type. Each section lists a 'Default' report option alongside any custom templates available for that audience, improving usability and choice.</li><li>Business Value: Empowers teams to create highly specific reports. For example, a PM can generate a 'Sprint Summary' report focusing on business value and risks, while QA can use a template for 'Test Coverage Analysis'. This customization makes the tool more integral to various team workflows.</li><li>Feature Delivery: This change represents a key deliverable for enhancing the product's reporting suite. Its completion is a prerequisite for any project milestones related to advanced reporting or stakeholder communication tools.</li><li>Integration with Milestones: The ability to generate custom reports can be tied directly to project phase gates or sprint review milestones, providing a standardized yet flexible method for progress documentation.</li>
                </ul>
            
        </div>
    
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Timeline and Resource Considerations</h2>
            <p>The implementation has timeline and dependency implications that require careful management.</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>Timeline Implications: As the pull request is still 'open', this feature is not yet delivered. Its completion should be prioritized if it is a blocker for other dependent features or scheduled milestone reviews.</li><li>Dependencies and Blockers: The entire feature is critically dependent on a functional backend. Specifically, the `/api/report-templates` endpoint must be deployed and stable, and the `/api/pull-requests/{id}/reports` endpoint must be updated to correctly process the new `templateId` parameter. Any delay in the backend development will directly block the release of this frontend feature.</li><li>Resource Allocation: The frontend work is being handled by 'Kinga-Jaworska'. Project management must ensure that backend resources are aligned and that there is clear communication between the frontend and backend developers to facilitate smooth integration and testing.</li>
                </ul>
            
        </div>
    
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies</h2>
            <p>Several project and technical risks should be considered for successful delivery and adoption.</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>Risk - API Dependency: A failure in the template-fetching API could degrade the user experience. Mitigation: The current implementation gracefully handles an empty template list by falling back to default options, which is a good baseline. Adding explicit loading states and user-friendly error messages would further improve resilience.</li><li>Risk - User Onboarding & Adoption: Without proper guidance, users may not understand how to create or effectively use templates, leading to low adoption of this powerful feature. Mitigation: Plan for the creation of user documentation, in-app tutorials, or a release announcement that clearly explains the new functionality.</li><li>Risk - Template Proliferation: An unmanaged system could lead to a large number of redundant, outdated, or poorly named templates, creating confusion. Mitigation: Develop a basic governance strategy for template management, potentially including features for archiving, deleting, and searching templates in a future iteration.</li><li>Risk - UI Scalability: If a large number of templates are created for a single audience, the dropdown menu could become long and difficult to navigate. Mitigation: While not an immediate concern, a future enhancement could include a searchable dropdown or a dedicated template management interface if usage grows significantly.</li>
                </ul>
            
        </div>
    
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Stakeholder Communication Points</h2>
            <p>Clear communication is essential for a smooth rollout of this feature.</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>For the Product Team: Announce the upcoming availability of customizable reporting. Emphasize that this will enable more targeted communication artifacts and enhance the tool's value proposition.</li><li>For End Users (PMs, QA, etc.): Prepare release notes detailing how to use the new feature. Example: 'You can now generate reports from custom templates! Look for the updated 'Generate Report' dropdown to select templates tailored to your needs.'</li><li>For Leadership: Position this feature as a strategic improvement that enhances project oversight and stakeholder communication, providing more flexible and powerful data presentation capabilities.</li>

        <div class="test-scenarios">
            <h2>■ Recommended Test Scenarios</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Verify that the 'Generate Report' dropdown correctly populates with templates grouped by audience type (PM, QA, Client) when the API returns data.</li><li>Confirm that selecting a specific template sends the correct `templateId` in the API request to the report generation endpoint.</li><li>Test the user experience when the template API is slow or unresponsive; ensure a loading indicator is present and the UI remains functional.</li><li>Verify that the dropdown gracefully handles the scenario where the API returns zero templates, showing only the 'Default' report options.</li><li>Confirm that selecting and generating a 'Default' report still functions as expected without sending a `templateId`.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    

    
        <div class="recommendations">
            <h2>★ Recommendations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Confirm the status and deployment schedule of the required backend API endpoints to de-risk the frontend delivery timeline.</li><li>Initiate planning for user documentation and release communications to ensure successful feature adoption upon launch.</li><li>Add a task to the project backlog to develop a simple template management and governance strategy to prevent future usability issues.</li><li>Merge this pull request upon successful integration testing with the backend services to avoid delaying dependent project milestones.</li>
