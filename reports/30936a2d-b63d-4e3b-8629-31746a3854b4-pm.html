    <div class="summary">
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>This pull request represents a monumental milestone, delivering the application's core vertical slice of functionality. It introduces user authentication via Google, complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for tasks, and the associated user interfaces. While this significantly accelerates the project timeline towards a viable product, the monolithic nature of the change and introduction of numerous dependencies present considerable risks in terms of reviewability, maintenance, and security that require immediate attention.</p>
    </div>

    
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Feature Impact Analysis</h2>
            <p>This PR delivers the foundational user experience, transforming the project from a technical boilerplate into a functional application. It enables the entire core user journey, which is critical for stakeholder demos, user testing, and validating the product's primary value proposition.</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>**User Authentication:** Implemented Google OAuth via NextAuth, allowing users to sign in and have a personalized experience.</li><li>**CRUD Functionality:** Users can now create, view, edit, and delete tasks, which is the central feature of the application.</li><li>**User Interface (UI):** New pages (`/login`, `/start`, `/add`) and interactive components (modals, forms) have been built to support the new functionality.</li><li>**Architecture Foundation:** Establishes key architectural patterns by integrating React Query for data fetching, Formik for form management, and SASS for styling.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Timeline and Resource Considerations</h2>
            <p>The completion of this work package marks the achievement of a major project milestone. The scale of the PR suggests a significant time and resource investment by a senior developer, single-handedly establishing the application's technical and functional baseline.</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>**Milestone Achieved:** Delivery of the core 'Task Management System v1' feature set is complete.</li><li>**Timeline Acceleration:** The project is now positioned to move into phases of user feedback, iteration, and development of secondary features.</li><li>**Resource Allocation:** Demonstrates high productivity from the assigned developer. However, the PR's size implies this may have been a bottleneck; future work should be broken into smaller, more manageable tasks to improve flow.</li><li>**Future Overhead:** The introduction of 20+ new dependencies creates future work in terms of maintenance, security patching, and bundle size optimization.</li>
                </ul>
            
        </div>
    
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Risk Assessment & Mitigation Strategies</h2>
            <p>The primary risks stem from the size of the PR and the rapid introduction of new systems. These risks impact code quality, security, and long-term maintainability. Proactive mitigation is required.</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>**High Risk - Monolithic Change:** Reviewing over 2600 lines of code across 30 files is prone to error. **Mitigation:** Mandate a thorough, multi-reviewer sign-off and allocate extended time for QA testing. Enforce smaller, incremental PRs for all future work.</li><li>**Medium Risk - Architectural Complexity:** The PR introduces multiple state management libraries (Redux and Zustand are listed in dependencies), which could lead to confusion and inconsistencies. **Mitigation:** Schedule an architectural review to clarify the state management strategy and deprecate redundant libraries.</li><li>**Medium Risk - Security Vulnerabilities:** Authentication logic and credential management are sensitive. The use of `localStorage` for tokens is not a best practice. **Mitigation:** Conduct a dedicated security review. Prioritize moving token storage from `localStorage` to secure, httpOnly cookies to prevent XSS attacks.</li><li>**Low Risk - Incomplete Features:** Code contains several `// TODO` comments, specifically around error handling. **Mitigation:** Create follow-up tasks in the project backlog to address all `TODO`s before any production release.</li>
                </ul>
            
        </div>
    
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Stakeholder Communication Points</h2>
            <p>Clear and targeted communication is needed to align stakeholders on the project's new status, manage expectations, and coordinate next steps.</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>**Product Team:** The MVP's core functionality is ready for User Acceptance Testing (UAT). We can now plan for the next cycle of user stories based on this foundation.</li><li>**QA Team:** An end-to-end testing plan is required, focusing on the authentication flow and all CRUD operations for tasks. Pay special attention to form validation and failure states.</li><li>**Development Team:** A tech-debt and architecture refinement session is recommended to discuss the new dependency stack, establish coding conventions, and plan the work for addressing `TODO`s and security enhancements.</li>
                </ul>
            
        </div>
    

    
        <div class="test-scenarios">
            <h2>ðŸ“‹ Recommended Test Scenarios</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>**Authentication:** User can successfully log in using a Google account and is redirected to the '/start' page. Session is persisted across page reloads.</li><li>**Task Creation:** User can open the 'Add Task' form, fill in all fields with valid data, and submit successfully. The new task appears in the task list.</li><li>**Form Validation:** The 'Add/Edit Task' forms display appropriate error messages for invalid inputs (e.g., empty required fields, incorrect duration format).</li><li>**Task Editing:** User can open the 'Edit' modal for an existing task, modify its details, and save the changes. The task list updates to reflect the changes.</li><li>**Task Deletion:** User can successfully delete a task, and it is removed from the UI.</li><li>**Time Slot Addition:** User can add a new time slot to an existing task, and the change is reflected.</li><li>**Error Handling:** Verify that the UI displays a user-friendly message if an API call for creating, editing, or deleting a task fails.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    

    
        <div class="recommendations">
            <h2>ðŸ’¡ Recommendations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Immediately schedule a comprehensive code review session with at least two senior engineers.</li><li>Create technical debt stories in the backlog for all identified `TODO`s and security improvements (especially token storage).</li><li>Conduct a dependency audit to confirm the necessity of all new packages and to clarify the state management strategy (e.g., Redux vs. Zustand).</li><li>Update project documentation to reflect the new architecture, including authentication flow, state management, and data fetching patterns.</li>
