        <h1>Quality Assurance Report: New Authentication Feature</h1>
        <span class="audience-badge">Report for Quality Assurance</span>
    </div>

    <div class="summary">
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>This report outlines the quality assurance and testing strategy for the newly implemented authentication feature. Given that authentication is a critical, high-risk component of the application, a comprehensive and multi-layered testing approach is required to ensure security, reliability, and functionality. The changes in 'auth.js' and the introduction of a new 'auth-service' suggest a significant refactor or replacement of the existing login mechanism, necessitating a full regression and new feature validation.</p>
    </div>

    
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Testing Strategy Overview</h2>
            <p>The testing strategy will be risk-based, prioritizing security vulnerabilities, core functionality (login/logout), and access control. A combination of manual, automated, and exploratory testing is recommended. The primary goal is to validate that the new authentication system is secure, performs under load, and correctly manages user sessions and permissions without introducing regressions.</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>Phase 1: Component & Integration Testing of the new 'auth-service'.</li><li>Phase 2: Functional and UI testing of the login/logout flows.</li><li>Phase 3: Security and Performance testing.</li><li>Phase 4: Full regression testing of authentication-dependent features.</li><li>Phase 5: User Acceptance Testing (UAT) with key stakeholders.</li>
                </ul>
            
        </div>
    
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Functional Testing Requirements</h2>
            <p>Functional testing will focus on validating the core requirements of the authentication system from an end-user perspective. All user-facing interactions must be verified across supported platforms and browsers.</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>**Login/Logout Flow:** Verify users can successfully log in with valid credentials and log out, destroying their session.</li><li>**Credential Validation:** Ensure the system correctly rejects invalid, non-existent, or malformed credentials.</li><li>**Error Handling:** All failure scenarios (e.g., server error, invalid input, locked account) must present clear, user-friendly, and secure error messages that do not reveal system internals.</li><li>**Session Management:** Validate session creation, persistence across pages, timeout due to inactivity, and proper invalidation upon logout.</li><li>**Access Control:** Confirm that authenticated users can access protected resources while unauthenticated users are correctly denied access and redirected.</li>
                </ul>
            
        </div>
    
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Non-Functional Testing Considerations</h2>
            <p>Beyond basic functionality, the system must be robust, secure, and performant. These tests ensure the application meets enterprise-grade quality standards.</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>**Security Testing:** Focus on common vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), insecure direct object references, and credential stuffing. Penetration testing is highly recommended.</li><li>**Performance Testing:** Conduct load testing on the authentication endpoint to measure response times and resource utilization under concurrent user load. Stress testing should be performed to identify the system's breaking point.</li><li>**Usability Testing:** Ensure the login process is intuitive and accessible. Error messages should be helpful without being overly technical.</li><li>**Compatibility Testing:** Verify the authentication flow works correctly across all supported browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and device types (desktop, tablet, mobile).</li>
                </ul>
            
        </div>
    
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Test Environment Setup Needs</h2>
            <p>A dedicated and properly configured testing environment is crucial for accurate and secure testing.</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>A staging environment that is a near-replica of production.</li><li>A test database populated with various user account types (e.g., active, locked, new, admin).</li><li>Tools for security scanning (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite) and performance testing (e.g., JMeter, K6).</li><li>Access to application logs to monitor authentication events and errors during testing.</li><li>Mock services for any external dependencies of the 'auth-service' to ensure isolated and reliable integration tests.</li>
                </ul>
            
        </div>
    
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Risk-Based Testing Prioritization</h2>
            <p>Testing efforts will be prioritized based on the risk and impact of potential failures.</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>**P0 (Critical):** Security vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS, broken access control), successful login with valid credentials (happy path), failure to log in with invalid credentials.</li><li>**P1 (High):** Session management (expiration, logout), access control for critical protected routes, brute-force attack prevention (account lockout/CAPTCHA).</li><li>**P2 (Medium):** UI/UX on the login page, performance under moderate load, password reset/recovery flows (if applicable).</li><li>**P3 (Low):** Case sensitivity of usernames (if applicable), concurrent session handling, minor UI cosmetic issues.</li>
                </ul>
            
        </div>
    

    
        <div class="test-scenarios">
            <h2>ðŸ“‹ Recommended Test Scenarios</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Verify a registered user can log in with a valid username and password and is redirected to the dashboard.</li><li>Verify a user attempting to log in with a correct username but an incorrect password receives a 'Invalid credentials' error.</li><li>Verify a user attempting to log in with a non-existent username receives a generic 'Invalid credentials' error message.</li><li>Verify that submitting the login form with both username and password fields empty displays appropriate validation messages.</li><li>Verify an authenticated user's session expires after the configured inactivity period, requiring them to log in again to access protected routes.</li><li>Verify that clicking the 'Logout' button successfully invalidates the session token/cookie and redirects the user to the login page.</li><li>Verify that an unauthenticated user attempting to directly access a protected URL (e.g., '/dashboard') is redirected to the login page.</li><li>Test for brute-force protection by submitting 5 incorrect password attempts for a single user and verify the account is temporarily locked.</li><li>Attempt to log in using an SQL injection payload (e.g., ' or 1=1;--) in the username field and confirm that access is denied.</li><li>Attempt to enter a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payload (e.g., <script>alert(1)</script>) in the username field and verify it is sanitized and not executed.</li><li>After logging in, manually delete the session cookie from the browser and verify that the next request to a protected page fails.</li><li>Log in as a standard user and attempt to access an admin-only route (e.g., '/admin/users'), verifying that access is forbidden (403 error).</li><li>Measure the average response time of the authentication endpoint under a simulated load of 100 concurrent login requests.</li><li>Verify the login functionality works as expected on the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.</li><li>Confirm that the 'auth-service' integration is correctly handled, especially its error states (e.g., service unavailable), and a graceful error is shown to the user.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    

    
        <div class="recommendations">
            <h2>ðŸ’¡ Recommendations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Develop a comprehensive suite of automated regression tests covering all P0 and P1 scenarios to run on every commit.</li><li>Conduct a formal security review and penetration test before deploying to production.</li><li>Ensure detailed logging is implemented for authentication successes and failures to aid in security monitoring and troubleshooting.</li><li>Document the new authentication flow and API endpoints for internal use and future development.</li>
