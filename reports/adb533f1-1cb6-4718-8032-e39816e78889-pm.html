    <div class="summary">
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>This pull request introduces a new, foundational authentication system, representing a critical project milestone. It directly impacts user security, the onboarding experience, and enables future features requiring user accounts. The change is significant, with a dependency on a new 'auth-service' that requires careful management of risk, resources, and stakeholder communication to ensure a successful rollout.</p>
    </div>

    
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Executive Summary & Business Impact</h2>
            <p>The implementation of a new authentication feature is a strategic initiative aimed at enhancing platform security and improving the user lifecycle management. This feature is a prerequisite for launching personalized user experiences, subscription models, and other core business objectives. Its successful deployment will increase user trust, provide valuable user data, and unlock new revenue streams. Failure to implement this correctly poses a significant risk to brand reputation and data integrity.</p>
            
        </div>
    
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Feature Impact Analysis</h2>
            <p>This pull request replaces or significantly alters the existing authentication mechanism by integrating a new, dedicated 'auth-service'. This is a high-impact change affecting the entire user-facing login and registration process.</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>User-Facing Changes: Users will experience a new sign-up and login flow. This could include UI changes, different password requirements, or new options like social logins (if in scope).</li><li>Backend Architecture: Establishes a centralized authentication service, decoupling it from other application logic. This is a positive architectural step but introduces a new critical dependency.</li><li>Data Management: May require a migration strategy for existing user credentials, which must be handled securely and without user disruption.</li><li>Security Posture: Fundamentally changes how user identity and access are managed, directly impacting the application's overall security.</li>
                </ul>
            
        </div>
    
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Timeline and Resource Considerations</h2>
            <p>The 'open' state of this PR indicates that the feature is still under active development. As a core platform component, its completion is on the critical path for other dependent features. The scope requires a multi-disciplinary effort.</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>Timeline Dependency: This feature is a blocker for any upcoming project milestones related to user accounts, personalization, or secured content.</li><li>Resource Allocation: Requires dedicated time from the author ('demo-user') and necessitates immediate involvement from Quality Assurance (QA) for test plan creation, a Security Engineer for vulnerability assessment, and potentially DevOps for infrastructure setup of the new service.</li><li>Project Scheduling: The project plan must account for a comprehensive testing and hardening phase after the initial development is complete. A premature launch is a high-risk scenario.</li>
                </ul>
            
        </div>
    
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Risk Assessment and Mitigation</h2>
            <p>The highest risks associated with this change are security vulnerabilities and negative user experience. A proactive risk mitigation strategy is essential.</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>Risk: Introduction of security flaws (e.g., session hijacking, insecure credential storage). Mitigation: Mandate a formal security audit and third-party penetration testing before release.</li><li>Risk: Unsuccessful data migration for existing users. Mitigation: Develop and test a migration script in a staging environment. Prepare a rollback plan.</li><li>Risk: Poor user experience leading to increased churn or support tickets. Mitigation: Conduct usability testing on the new login/registration flows. Prepare customer support with new documentation and FAQs.</li><li>Risk: New 'auth-service' becomes a single point of failure. Mitigation: Ensure the service has high availability, robust monitoring, and alerting. Plan for graceful degradation in case of service failure.</li>
                </ul>
            
        </div>
    
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Stakeholder Communication Points</h2>
            <p>This change requires clear and coordinated communication across multiple departments.</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>Product & Design Teams: Must formally sign off on the user flow and experience to ensure it aligns with product goals.</li><li>Customer Support Team: Must be trained on the new authentication process to assist users effectively and identify potential bugs post-launch.</li><li>Marketing Team: Needs to be briefed on the new capabilities and any user-facing changes to prepare for public announcements or updates to marketing materials.</li><li>Leadership: Should be updated on the project's status, risks, and timeline implications, as it is a key component for strategic business initiatives.</li>
                </ul>
            
        </div>
    

    
        <div class="test-scenarios">
            <h2>ðŸ“‹ Recommended Test Scenarios</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Verify successful user registration and subsequent login.</li><li>Test failed login attempts with invalid credentials and verify appropriate error messaging.</li><li>Validate the entire 'Forgot Password' flow, from request to successful login with a new password.</li><li>Confirm that user sessions are managed correctly (e.g., session expiry, 'Remember Me' functionality).</li><li>Test that all protected application routes are inaccessible to unauthenticated users.</li><li>Perform security tests for common vulnerabilities like credential stuffing, SQL injection, and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).</li><li>Simulate a failure of the 'auth-service' to ensure the application handles the error gracefully without crashing.</li>

        <div class="recommendations">
            <h2>ðŸ’¡ Recommendations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Prioritize a mandatory security code review and vulnerability scan for this pull request and the dependent 'auth-service'.</li><li>Allocate QA resources immediately to develop a comprehensive test suite covering functional, integration, performance, and security scenarios.</li><li>Define a clear deployment plan, preferably using a phased rollout with feature flagging to minimize production impact.</li><li>Confirm that a detailed data migration and rollback strategy is documented and tested for existing users.</li><li>Schedule a project sync to align all stakeholders (Product, Engineering, Support) on the final scope and release timeline.</li>
