        <h1>Enhanced Security: New User Authentication System</h1>
        <span class="audience-badge">Report for Client</span>
    </div>

    <div class="summary">
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>This pull request introduces a foundational new authentication system designed to significantly enhance platform security, improve the user login experience, and establish a robust framework for future identity and access management features. This strategic upgrade is crucial for protecting user data and building trust.</p>
    </div>

    
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Business Value Summary</h2>
            <p>The implementation of a new authentication service is a critical infrastructure investment. It directly addresses the growing need for enhanced security, protecting both our users and the business from potential threats. By modernizing our login system, we not only bolster our security posture but also lay the groundwork for future premium features that require secure, verified user identities, such as role-based access control and third-party integrations.</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>Strengthens platform security and mitigates risks of unauthorized access.</li><li>Increases user trust and confidence in the platform's ability to protect their data.</li><li>Provides a scalable foundation for future security enhancements and features.</li><li>Standardizes the login process, reducing long-term maintenance costs and complexity.</li>
                </ul>
            
        </div>
    
        <div class="section">
            <h2>User Impact Analysis</h2>
            <p>Users will experience a more secure and potentially streamlined login process. This update is the first step towards offering modern authentication methods like Single Sign-On (SSO) or multi-factor authentication (MFA). While the initial change might require users to familiarize themselves with a slightly updated login interface, the long-term benefit is a safer and more reliable user experience.</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>Improved account security for all users.</li><li>A consistent and reliable login experience across all devices.</li><li>Potential for a passwordless or social login experience in future iterations.</li><li>Clearer error messaging and support for account recovery.</li>
                </ul>
            
        </div>
    
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Feature Overview in Business Terms</h2>
            <p>This initiative replaces our current, aging login mechanism with a modern, dedicated authentication service. This new system will handle all aspects of user identity, from initial sign-up and login to password resets. Think of it as upgrading the front door lock on our application from a standard key to a modern, electronic system that is harder to break and easier to manage and upgrade.</p>
            
                <ul>
                    
                </ul>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Expected Outcomes and Benefits</h2>
            <p>The primary outcome is a significant reduction in security vulnerabilities related to user authentication. This will lead to increased platform stability, enhanced user trust, and a stronger competitive position by demonstrating a commitment to data security.</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduced incidence of account takeover attempts.</li><li>Compliance with modern security best practices.</li><li>Increased developer velocity for features that depend on user authentication.</li><li>Positive impact on brand reputation as a secure and trustworthy platform.</li>
                </ul>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Next Steps and Future Enhancements</h2>
            <p>Following the successful deployment of this foundational system, the roadmap is open to several high-value enhancements that will further improve security and user convenience.</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>Introduction of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) via SMS or authenticator apps.</li><li>Integration of social logins (e.g., Google, LinkedIn) for faster onboarding.</li><li>Development of Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities for enterprise clients.</li><li>Implementation of session management controls for administrators.</li>
                </ul>
            
        </div>
    

    
        <div class="test-scenarios">
            <h2>ðŸ“‹ Recommended Test Scenarios</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Verify that existing users can seamlessly log in with their current credentials.</li><li>Confirm that new users can successfully register and authenticate.</li><li>Test the complete password reset and account recovery workflow.</li><li>Attempt to log in with invalid credentials to ensure appropriate error messages and security lockouts are triggered.</li><li>Validate that user sessions are created, managed, and terminated securely upon logout or timeout.</li>
