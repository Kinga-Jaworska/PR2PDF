        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>This pull request, titled 'Edit layout', introduces a substantial and foundational set of features and architectural patterns, far exceeding the scope suggested by its title. It implements a full user authentication system via Google, establishes a modern frontend architecture with Redux and React Query, and delivers the core functionality for a task management system, including task creation and editing. This PR represents a significant milestone, effectively building the application's MVP backbone. However, its large size introduces considerable risks related to code review complexity, potential for bugs, and integration challenges.</p>

            <h2>Executive Summary: Business Value and Feature Delivery</h2>
            <p>This pull request delivers critical business value by launching the core feature set for a task management application. It moves the project from a conceptual stage to a tangible, functional prototype. The primary deliverables are a secure Google authentication system and the end-to-end user flow for creating and editing tasks. Architecturally, it establishes a scalable foundation using industry-standard libraries, which will accelerate future development cycles and improve maintainability. This is a major step towards achieving the project's primary milestones for a minimum viable product (MVP).</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Feature Impact Analysis</h2>
            <p>The PR introduces several high-impact, user-facing and architectural features:</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>User Authentication: A complete Google OAuth sign-in/sign-out flow is implemented using NextAuth, providing a secure and seamless entry point for users.</li><li>Task Creation: A new page and dedicated form allow users to create new tasks, specifying details like title, description, start time, and end time.</li><li>Task Editing & Management: An 'Edit' modal provides functionality to modify existing tasks, a core requirement for the application's usability.</li><li>Time Slot Addition: Introduces the concept of adding 'time slots' to tasks, hinting at more advanced scheduling capabilities.</li><li>Modern Frontend Architecture: Establishes a robust technical foundation by integrating Redux for state management, React Query for efficient data fetching, and Formik for scalable forms.</li>
                </ul>
            
        </div>
    
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Timeline and Resource Considerations</h2>
            <p>The scale of this PR (30 files, ~2500 new lines) indicates a significant investment of development resources, likely spanning a full sprint or more for a single developer. The introduction of multiple complex libraries (NextAuth, Redux, React Query) at once creates a considerable learning curve for the rest of the team, which may temporarily slow down subsequent development until the team is fully onboarded. The monolithic nature of the PR will extend the code review and testing phases, potentially causing a bottleneck and delaying the merge into the main branch. This single large delivery makes incremental progress tracking difficult.</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>Large Scope: Combines architecture, authentication, and multiple features, delaying integration.</li><li>Resource Allocation: Represents a substantial work package by a single developer, highlighting a need to parallelize work or break down tasks differently in the future.</li><li>Future Velocity: The new architecture, while powerful, requires team-wide adoption and may impact timelines for the next few sprints as developers adapt.</li>
                </ul>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies</h2>
            <p>The primary risk stems from the PR's size and complexity. A single, large-scale change increases the difficulty of review, testing, and potential rollbacks.</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>Risk: Monolithic Change. A single PR introduces architecture, auth, and features, making it extremely difficult to review thoroughly and increasing the chance of hidden bugs.</li><li>Mitigation: Mandate smaller, incremental PRs for future work. For this PR, assign multiple senior developers to the review process and allocate significant time for QA to perform exhaustive testing.</li><li>Risk: Backend Dependency. The frontend is tightly coupled to a local backend API (`http://localhost:3000`). Any changes or downtime on the backend will block all frontend functionality.</li><li>Mitigation: Abstract API endpoints into environment variables for staging/production flexibility. Establish a clear, versioned API contract between frontend and backend teams.</li><li>Risk: Architectural Complexity. Introducing Redux, React Query, and a custom Auth context simultaneously can lead to over-engineering or incorrect implementation patterns.</li><li>Mitigation: Conduct a dedicated architectural review session with the team to validate the setup and establish clear guidelines on when and how to use each library.</li>
                </ul>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Stakeholder Communication Points</h2>
            <p>Clear communication is crucial to align stakeholders on the progress and next steps.</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>To Product Management: 'The foundational MVP features, including Google login and core task management, have been implemented. This unblocks development for subsequent user stories like task deletion, listing, and filtering.'</li><li>To QA Team: 'A major feature set is ready for end-to-end testing. Please prioritize the user authentication flow and the full lifecycle of a task (create and edit). A full regression test is highly recommended due to the extensive changes.'</li><li>To Development Team: 'This PR sets our core frontend architecture. We need to schedule a knowledge-sharing session to walk through the new patterns for state management and data fetching. We will also be enforcing a new policy for smaller, more focused pull requests.'</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Verify user can successfully sign in with a valid Google account.</li><li>Verify user is redirected to the login page if they are not authenticated.</li><li>Verify user can successfully sign out.</li><li>Test the task creation form with valid data and verify the API call is made correctly.</li><li>Test the task creation form with invalid data (e.g., end time before start time) and verify form validation works.</li><li>Verify the 'Edit' modal pre-populates with the correct task data.</li><li>Verify submitting the 'Edit' modal successfully updates the task via an API call.</li>

            <h2>ðŸ’¡ Recommendations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Break down future work into smaller, feature-specific pull requests (e.g., Auth, Task Form, API Hooks should be separate).</li><li>Conduct a thorough, multi-reviewer code review before merging due to the PR's size and complexity.</li><li>Abstract the hardcoded `localhost` API endpoint into environment variables to support different deployment environments.</li><li>Organize a team-wide session to document and explain the new architectural patterns (Redux, React Query) to ensure consistency in future development.</li>
