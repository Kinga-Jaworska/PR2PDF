### Puppeteer/PDF Generation Setup

This application uses Puppeteer to generate PDF reports. The configuration is optimized for Replit environments but may need adjustment for local development:

**For Replit**: No additional setup required - Chromium path is preconfigured.

**For Local Development**: 
- Install Chrome/Chromium on your system
- The app will attempt to use the system's Chrome installation
- If you encounter PDF generation issues, you may need to:
  1. Install Puppeteer Chromium: `npx puppeteer install`
  2. Or set a custom executable path in `server/services/pdf.ts`

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd pr-insight
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up the database**
   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Access the application**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` (port may vary - check console logs)
